# Remaining-Shelf-Life-Estimation-of-fruits-and-Vegetables-during-transportation
Predicting the shelf-life of fresh produce during transportation minimizes waste and ensures quality. By integrating real-time environmental data with machine learning, this method dynamically estimates shelf-life, optimizing inventory and logistics while reducing spoilage more effectively than static methods.
